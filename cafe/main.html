        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>At Crumbs & Co, our story is as sweet as our cupcakes. It all started with a passionate baker and a dream. The founder, Sarah, fell in love with baking at an early age. Her grandma's secret cupcake recipes became the inspiration for what would later become Crumbs & Co. She dreamed of creating a space where people could gather and indulge in the simple joys of life, one cupcake at a time.</p>
        <br>
        <p>After years of experimenting with flavors, perfecting recipes, and sharing her creations with friends and family, Sarah decided to open Crumbs & Co. In 2010, our cozy little cafe opened its doors, and we've been spreading the love of cupcakes ever since.</p>
